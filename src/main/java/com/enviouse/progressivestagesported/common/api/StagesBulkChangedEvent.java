/**
 * Event fired when multiple stages change at once (bulk operation).
 *
 * <p>Use cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Player login - snapshot of all stages synced</li>
 *   <li>Team join - inheriting team's stages</li>
 *   <li>Config reload - stages may have changed</li>
 *   <li>Linear progression - prerequisites auto-granted</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This event allows listeners to perform ONE recheck instead of N rechecks
 * when multiple stages change simultaneously.
 *
 * <p>Note: Individual {@link StageChangeEvent}s are NOT fired when this event
 * is used - listeners should handle both event types.
